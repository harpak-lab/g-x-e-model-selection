# Gene-Environment Interaction Analysis with Performer Neural Networks

This project is an implementation of performer neural networks to analyze Gene-Environment (GxE) interactions and their impact on phenotypic predictions. It's based on the code developed by Måløy et al., available at [https://github.com/haakom/pay-attention-to-genomic-selection](https://github.com/haakom/pay-attention-to-genomic-selection).

## Features

- 10-fold Cross-Validation
- Hyperparameter optimization with Optuna
- Support for SLURM-based cluster optimization
- Customizable settings for dataset handling and model training

## Installation

To install the necessary components for this project, ensure that you have Anaconda installed. To clone the repository and set up the environment:

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/harpak-lab/g-x-e-model-selection.git

2. Navigate to the source directory:
cd g-x-e-model-selection/src

3. Create the Anaconda environment from the `environment.yml` file:
conda env create -f environment.yml

After creating the environment, activate it using `conda activate GxE_predict_phenotypes`

## Phenotype files
Phenotype files are obtained from the UK Biobank and renamed dataset/pheno_(phenotype code).txt.*******

## Genotype files
Imputed data for the UK Biobank was downloaded using the ([ukbgene utility](https://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/refer.cgi?id=664)) in the Oxford bgen format.

## Context (Environment) files
Context files are obtained from the UK Biobank******

## Data Preprocessing

Before running the main model, it's essential to preprocess your data using the provided script.

### Steps for Data Preprocessing

****** make sure environment.yml file is updated with the packages you need to preprocess data oops

1. **Locate the Preprocessing Script**: Find `preprocess_data.sh` in the create_filtered_vcf_version_of_genotype_file directory.

2. **Run the Preprocessing Script**: Execute the script with the necessary arguments. For example:

./preprocess_data.py <put arguments here ********>

Replace <arguments******> with the actual paths to your input data and where you want the preprocessed data to be saved.

## Usage

To run the project:

python main.py <additional flags>

### Key Arguments

- `--hyper_search`: Set to 1 for hyperparameter search.
- `--total_num_trials`: Number of trials for the study.
- `--database_name`: Path to the hyperparameter search database.
- `--datasets_dir`: Directory where datasets are stored.
- `--dataset`: Name of the dataset to use.
- `--inverse_transform`: Path to the inverse transform of the target data.
- `--standardize_genome`: Set to 1 to standardize the genome data.
- `--batch_size`: Batch size for training.
- `--num_epochs`: Number of epochs for training.
- More arguments can be configured in the script.

For example, in the src folder, you can run:

python main.py \
        --total_num_trials 3 \
        --database_name ../hyperparameter_search_database.sqlite \
        --datasets_dir ../dataset/ \
        --dataset genome_HDL_phenotype_context_data.lmdb \
        --inverse_transform HDL_phenotype_scaler.joblib \
        --num_hparams_explor 10 \
        --batch_size 50 \
        --gene_length 3000 \
        --gene_size 4 \
        --num_nodes 3 \
        --num_epochs 10 \
        --gpus 0 \
